# Why Journal Club?

The ability to read and understand scientific literature is a key skill for any AI practitioner. The fast pace of our field means that many textbooks are outdated the minute they hit the shelves, so the only way to truly understand the cutting-edge of artificial intelligence is to read the research hot off the press. Though AI blogs are wonderful resources and can make complex topics accessible to a wide audience, ultimately they provide someone else's summary or interpretation of a core idea, instead of the idea itself. This game of "telephone" can be risky: did the author truly understand what's taking place? Did they even read the paper? :)

Additionally, engaging with scientific manuscripts sharpens our ability to leverage the scientific method. As a refresher, the scientific method is a structured, evidence-based process by which humans build knowledge about the world. Its steps are:

a) Observation - _Notice something interesting in the world_ ("Bacteria isn't growing on this moldy petri dish.")

b) Question - _Ask a specific and *testable* question_ ("Does this mold kill bacteria?")

c) Hypothesis - _Propose a *testable* explanation_ ("When this mold encounters bacteria, it has the ability to kill them")

d) Experiment - _Design and conduct controlled tests to collect relevant data_ ("I will create 10 moldy petri dishes using the exact same mold, and then place a different type of bacteria on each plate and observe growth patterns")

e) Analysis - _Examine the data and determine whether it supports or refutes the hypothesis_ ("None of the bacteria colonies grew on the modly plates")

f) Conclusion - _Draw logical conclusions and communicate results_ ("This mold can kill bacteria through an unknown mechanism")

When you read a textbook, you usually only recieve the final step ("Conclusion"), and it's (hopefully!) laid out in a nice, logical flow. Textbooks are perfect for _consuming_ knowledge, but as scientists we want to _produce_ knowledge. In this way, we have the privilege of pushing the boundaries of human understanding and, in doing so, frequently become the first person in  history to learn/see/understand something new.  And the only way to produce this knowledge is through our understanding and application of the scientific method, which is sharpened by seeing many examples (both good and bad) written out in the form of scientific papers! These examples help us learn to dissect methodology, effectively interpret data, and identify the strength of an author's reasoning.

Not only do academic papers sharpen our general scientific method skills, but they also raise _specific_ ideas and hypotheses we might want to test. "This paper only applied basic NLP approaches to investor sentiment. I hypothesize that more advanced NLP methods would enable XYZ." Once we have the hypothesis, we can proceed straight into the scientific method workflow.



# How to read a scientific paper
The most common mistake we make when reading a scientific paper is to think of it like a textbook, and read in a linear fashion from start to finish. But because scientific articles are dense arguments and not stories, we need to learn to be more efficient and read strategically. The good news is that every paper largely follows the same format (Abstract -> Introduction -> Methods -> Results -> Conclusion), so we only need to develop a single approach and we'll be set!

I recommend the following, three-step process:

## 1) Overview
Read the title and abstract carefully. Ask yourself "What is this paper about?" Can you identify the main question/hypothesis, and the context of the paper (that is, is it a methods paper? A specific application? A literature review?)

Once you've done that, look through the figures/charts, and their legends. Try to understand the paper's overarching story from the visuals. Ask yourself "What variables are being tested? What are the results, and how are they being communicated? Are there any surprises? Are there trends, comparisons or performance benchmarks?"

In this manner, you end up building a mental model that provides structure as you read the paper more deeply.


## 2) Full pass
Once you've built your mental model, read the Introduction, Method and Results sections more carefully. Can you see how the authors used (or didn't use) the scientific method in constructing their workflow? Pay attention to the experimental setup, as well as any defined metrics. Can you explain the metrics in your own words? At this point you should also go back and review the figures we looked at in Part 1). Do they still line up with your original understanding, or has your understanding changed?

Next, review the Conclusions section. Based on the understanding you developed in the first half of Part 2), do you agree with the logic behind the conclusions being drawn? Do these conclusions still match with the overarching claims the paper is making?


## 3) Critique
Now that we've _consumed_ the paper (that is, we understand what it's saying) it's time to apply our critical thinking and _produce_.  What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper? Where do we see opportunities to extend the research being presented, or perhaps challenge it? And perhaps most importantly, how does this change our worldview as AI practitioners? A new PEFT method such as q-LORA could have massive impact on our daily workflow, whereas a case study in an adjacent discipline might simply serve as a helpful analogy to file away for some later use.



# What to bring to a journal club
The main expectation, of course, is that you've read the paper :) Beyond that, be ready to discuss the following:

1) The main hypothesis & contribution made by the paper
  
2) Methodological strengths & flaws

3) Potential applications or extensions

4) Questions you still have or parts you don't understand

You may not be able to fully determine the hypothesis, or you may not have a strong opinion on flaws or applications (particularly if you don't have a ton of prior experience with scientific literature). That's ok! The main thing is to keep at it, and stay consistently engaged as practice makes perfect. Also, remember that no one knows everything - an expert in field A might struggle to understand foundational principles of field B. And that's the last (and arguably most important) benefit of journal club: building an environment of welcome, collaborative learning that fosters intellectual growth and sparks new research ideas.

# How journal club works
We will meet *bi-weekly* for 60 minutes. One person will serve as the presenter for each paper, and will create a short 5-10 minute summary that covers:

a) The main hypothesis

b) Methods used

c) Key results and acknowledged limitations

This will serve to ground the group in Parts 1 and 2 of paper reading (Overview & Full Pass).

Next, we will launch into Part 3: critique. The rest of the time will be spent on discussion and critique. Participants should bring up their opinions of strengths/weaknesses/applications, and engage with other points of view. The presenter will serve as moderator and help guide the conversations. Sometimes we'll go over our 60 minutes, and sometimes we'll end early. Both are more than ok - some papers are just more interesting than others :)

If you're not sure whether to sign up as a presenter, I'd recommend first observing 1-2 sessions to get the hang of things, as well as to get some experience in dissecting papers. That said, this is a welcoming community so don't stress too much!
